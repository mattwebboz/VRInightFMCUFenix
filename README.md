This is work in progress of a working VRInfight MCP (Airbus) with Fenix using FenixQuarz and Spad.Next.    The speed, heading, altitude and virtible speed was written from scratch.   The radio /nav section was imported from an existing profile.

This will work in the trial version of Spad.Next if you want to see if you can get it working.


To use:
- backup your existing FenixQuartz.config file and replace it with the one provided

Backup
- in Spad.Next, go to the MCP2A config page
-   Click on the arrow next to Edit Event
-   Choose copy, then complete device
-   Open notepad
-   Paste the text and save.    This is your backup if this doesn't work for you

  -   Copy the text
  -   In Spad.Next, still on the MCP2A config page, Click on the arrow next to Edit Event
